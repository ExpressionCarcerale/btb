<h2>Delete account permanently?</h2>
<p>
Are you sure you want to delete your account?  This cannot be undone.  You will
no longer be able to log in and all information about your profile will be
removed.
</p>

<form method='post' action=''>{% csrf_token %}
    <p>
        If you wish to also delete comments you have left, check the following
        box.
    </p>
    <p>
        <label for='delete_comments'>Delete comments</label>
        <input type='checkbox' name='delete_comments' id='delete_comments' /><br />
        <p>
        Note: Once things are on the Internet, it's nearly impossible for them
        to be removed completely.  Search engines and other sites may retain
        copies of the comments, and they may have been printed and mailed to
        the authors of blog posts.  However, we will make a good faith effort
        to remove your information.
        </p>
        <p>
        Once you delete your account, you will be unable to later delete
        comments if you don't delete them now.  Either way, your profile
        information will no longer be associated with the comments.
        </p>
