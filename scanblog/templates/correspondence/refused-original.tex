Thanks for writing us. Unfortunately, we can't publish or hold on to any blog posts or profiles from you until you've signed a license agreement with us.  We've recorded your name and address, and have put you in line to receive an introductory packet with the license agreement soon.  Once you've received and reviewed the license agreement, you're welcome to return any materials you'd like to publish to us with the signed agreement.  We're sorry for this inconvenience; but we have to stay on our lawyers' good side.  We hope to be in touch with you with a complete introductory packet as soon as we can, but due to our limited capacity, the waitlist is currently rather long. We don't currently have an estimate for how long it will take.
