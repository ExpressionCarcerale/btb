Between the Bars' developer documentation
=========================================

Between the Bars is a blogging platform for people in prison.  People in prison
in the US don't generally have access to the Internet, so it's necessary to
facilitate their blogging using paper mail.

To that end, BtB has sophisticated tools for managing, moderating, and
publishing scanned documents, as well as generating printable batched
correspodnence.  These features alone might make this codebase a compelling
alternative for anyone that must process large amounts of hand-written mail,
with or without publishing.

This documentation describes how to get started with installing and running a
development instance of Between the Bars.
